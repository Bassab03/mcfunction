# mcfunction-support for Atom

# CONTRIBUTE
I have stoped using atom as my text editor,
so I'm not as inclined to continue working on this extention.
I will do my best with look at the pull requests,
but if anyone would what to take over the repository,
it would be highly appriciated!

A syntax highlighter, auto-complete provider and snippet package for Minecraft 1.15
function files, built for the [Atom editor](https://atom.io/). The autocomplete
provider is *very* competent and almost has an identical feel to Minecraft's native
tab completions.

## Info
This is a fork of https://github.com/MrYurihi/mcfunction.
I have no idea how he made this, but adding and removing entries in a JSON file,
I do know how to do, so I updated it to 1.15. All Credit goes to them.

If you find something missing, a command, command option, id, etc.
Leave it as en issue or feel free to add them your self and do a pull request,
over at : https://github.com/Czaplicki/mcfunction-support-resources/


## IMO
This is the best available package on apm for datapacks in 1.15.
This is *not* the best available package on apm for datapacks in 1.13.  
For 1.13, use https://github.com/MrYurihi/mcfunction.
