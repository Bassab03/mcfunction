# mcfunction-lang syntax highlighter

A syntax highlighter and snippet package for Minecraft's function files

Supports 1.13+ and has a version for 1.12-

# Features:

- Items, Sounds, Enchantments, Biomes, Particles, Loot Tables, Objectives, Recipes, Effects, Entities, Blocks, Advancements, and Structures are kept up to date with the latest Minecraft snapshots.
- Syntax highlighting
- Autocomplete for commands, selectors, and more

# What's different about this mcfunction highligter?

This package, forked from [Yurihaia/mcfunction](https://github.com/Yurihaia/mcfunction), fixes many of the issues listed in it, adds more commands, items, entities, and has more suggestions, such as loot tables, sounds, and particles!

If you are using it for 1.15- functions, be careful that you don't use commands and items not in that version. Otherwise, this is currently one of the best mcfunction highlighters for 1.13+ for atom.

# Features I am thinking of adding:

- Suggestions for NBT tags and block states.
- Config option for minecraft version.
- Custom color picker for color-based nbt tags.
- Improved text highlighting.
